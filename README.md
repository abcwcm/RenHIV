# RenHIV
Scripts for the bulk RNA-seq analysis for Ren et al. where the transcriptomes of CD4 T cells with and without HIV infection were compared.

The `makefile` in the `preprocessing` directory contains all details of the alignment, QC, and read count procedure. 

The `code_for_figure` directory contains the read counts and metadata that are needed to run the code in the `.Rmd` document to generate the figures of the publication that were based on the bulk RNA-seq data set.
