>Ren Y, Huang SH, Macedo AB, Ward AR, Alberto WDC, Klevorn T, Leyre L, Copertino DC, Mota TM, Chan D, Truong R, Rohwetter T, Zumbo P, DÃ¼ndar F, Betel D, Kovacs C, Benko E, Bosque A, Jones RB. Selective BCL-XL Antagonists Eliminate Infected Cells from a Primary-Cell Model of HIV Latency but Not from Ex Vivo Reservoirs. J Virol. 2021 Jul 12;95(15):e0242520. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02425-20. Epub 2021 Jul 12. PMID: 33980597; PMCID: PMC8274617.

Read counts and scripts for the bulk RNA-seq analysis for [Ren et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33980597/) where the transcriptomes of CD4 T cells with and without HIV infection were compared.

The `makefile` in the `preprocessing` directory contains all details of the alignment, QC, and read count procedure. 

The `code_for_figure` directory **contains the read counts and metadata** that are needed to run the code in the `.Rmd` document to generate the figures of the publication that were based on the bulk RNA-seq data set.
